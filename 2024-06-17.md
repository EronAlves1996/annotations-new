[[Actual readings]]
* The jvm profiles information from the execution all it's time to perform runtime optimizations
* Mandrel is a graalvm distribution especifically for Quarkus
	* Don't supports polyglot programming, it means it reduces the distribution size
* SDKMan includes graal vm, but you have to install the native-image tool separately
* The Native Image Builder does some type of tree shaking. I have my doubts about the majority of forms dependency injection frameworks executes our code. Generally by instatiating the required classes, searching them on classpath on runtime. That way, our code is unreachable. That way we need to tell Native Image, how they are resolved
* `./mvnw clean package -Pnative` -> to invoke native profile on maven
	* Use `-Dquarkus.native.container-build=true` to build the image inside a docker container, without graal vm
		* Can be configurable via maven pom
* `docker run --rm` instructs docker to remove the container as soon as we stop it
