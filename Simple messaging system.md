A great mini project to practice the concepts from Chapter 1 of “Kafka: The Definitive Guide” would be to set up a basic Kafka environment and create a simple messaging system. Here’s a suggestion:

- [x] **Install and Run Kafka**: Set up Kafka on your local machine.
- [x] **Create Topics**: Make a topic named ‘test’ to send and receive messages.
- [x] **Produce Messages**: Write a simple producer script in Java that sends a series of messages to the ‘test’ topic.
- [x] **Consume Messages**: Write a consumer script that subscribes to the ‘test’ topic and prints out any messages it receives.
