Certainly! When working with Spring Boot and autowiring an interface with multiple implementations, you can create a mini project to explore this concept. Here are some steps to get you started:

- [x] *Define an Interface:*
   - Create an interface that represents the functionality you want to implement. For example, let's say you're building a notification system, and you have an NotificationService interface.

 - [x] *Implement Multiple Versions:*
   - Create multiple implementations of your interface. For instance, you could have EmailNotificationService, SMSNotificationService, and PushNotificationService.

- [x]  *Autowire the Implementations:*
   - In your Spring Boot application, use the @Autowired annotation to inject the appropriate implementation based on the context.;
   - You can use @Qualifier to specify which bean to inject when there are multiple candidatesÂ¹.
   - Alternatively, mark one of the implementations as @Primary to indicate the default choice when autowiringÂ¹.

- [x]  *Create a Mini Project:*
   - Build a simple application that demonstrates the usage of these services.
   - For example, create a REST API endpoint that allows users to choose their preferred notification type (email, SMS, or push) and send a sample notification.

 - [x] *Test and Observe:*
   - Test your application by invoking different endpoints and observing which implementation gets autowired.
   - Verify that the correct notification service is used based on the user's choice.

Remember to keep your mini project focused and straightforward. This will help you grasp the autowiring concepts effectively. Happy coding! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€Â¹Â².
