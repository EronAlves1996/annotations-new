- Spring
	- By default we'll get an error if we declare multiple beans that implement an interface and autowire the interface
	- We can use `@Qualifier` to be more specific, both in implementation and in the dependency declaration
		- The qualifier specified in the call site can be resolved by class name
		- We can specifiy the qualifier without the annotation, by simply specifiying by the variable identifier. It'll try to resolve the variable identifier with class name
	- We can use `@Primary` to specify that a component is the default implementation
	- Another thing usefull is gather all implementations into a collection (Map/List)
	- `@Conditional` is another way to select beans to autowire
	- Spring supports `Optional` autowiring
	- When autowire collections, we can use `@Order` to specify when the collection comes

- When benchmarking rust against Java, it potentially removes the overhead between Option and Box
