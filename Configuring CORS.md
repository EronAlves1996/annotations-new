### Exercise 1: Understanding CORS

- **Objective:** Understand the concept of CORS and its implications for web applications.
- **Task:**
    - Define CORS.
    - Explain why CORS is necessary.
    - Describe the preflight request and its purpose.
    - Identify potential CORS errors that can occur.

### Exercise 2: Setting Up a Basic Micronaut Application

- **Objective:** Create a basic Micronaut application as a foundation for CORS configuration.
- **Task:**
    - Create a new Micronaut project using the Micronaut CLI or your preferred IDE.
    - Add necessary dependencies (e.g., Micronaut Core, HTTP Client).
    - Define a simple controller with an endpoint returning a greeting.

### Exercise 3: Creating a Static Website

- **Objective:** Develop a static website to interact with the Micronaut application.
- **Task:**
    - Create a basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file structure.
    - Implement a JavaScript function to make a fetch request to the Micronaut endpoint.
    - Display the response from the Micronaut application on the webpage.

### Exercise 4: Encountering CORS Errors

- **Objective:** Experience a CORS error firsthand.
- **Task:**
    - Run both the Micronaut application and the static website.
    - Attempt to make a request from the static website to the Micronaut endpoint.
    - Analyze the CORS error message in the browser console.

### Exercise 5: Enabling Global CORS Configuration

- **Objective:** Configure CORS globally for the Micronaut application.
- **Task:**
    - Add the necessary Micronaut configuration to enable CORS.
    - Specify allowed origins, methods, and headers.
    - Test the application again and verify that the CORS error is resolved.

### Exercise 6: Fine-Grained CORS Configuration

- **Objective:** Implement more specific CORS configuration for different endpoints.
- **Task:**
    - Use annotations to configure CORS settings at the controller or method level.
    - Create different CORS configurations for various endpoints.
    - Test the application to ensure correct behavior.

### Exercise 7: Testing with Different Origins

- **Objective:** Verify CORS configuration with multiple origins.
- **Task:**
    - Modify the static website to use different domains or ports.
    - Test the Micronaut application with these different origins.
    - Adjust CORS configuration as needed to accommodate multiple origins.

### Exercise 8: Handling Preflight Requests

- **Objective:** Understand and handle preflight requests.
- **Task:**
    - Explain the purpose of preflight requests.
    - Verify that the Micronaut application responds correctly to preflight requests.
    - Customize preflight response headers if necessary.

### Exercise 9: Troubleshooting CORS Issues

- **Objective:** Identify and resolve common CORS problems.
- **Task:**
    - Troubleshoot CORS errors related to allowed origins, methods, and headers.
    - Debug issues with preflight requests.
    - Consider security implications when configuring CORS.

### Additional Exercises (Optional)

- Implement CORS configuration using Micronaut's configuration properties.
- Explore advanced CORS features like credentials and exposed headers.
- Integrate CORS with authentication and authorization mechanisms.
