* Global state goes for inflexibility, as goes for requiring mutating the global state
* If we have a global state, it means this state is one and only. If I need to mutate, I need a lock to guarantee that other threads cannot mutate it at the same time
* I think, the best thing to avoid global state is to make the relevant data for a single context imutable. It can be made by passing as parameter and with immutable dependency injection
* Dependency Injection frameworks simplifies the resolution of Dependency Graphs, because, the dependency management will be automatized and the refactoring would be more easy. The system would be easier to change
