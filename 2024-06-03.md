* Security
	* Normally, for JWT authentication, you'll want an external identity manager to authenticate and generate JWT's
	* Your application only need to verify the bearer token upon any http received request
	* Identity and Access Management tool
	* The IAM tool holds the private key and the application holds the public key JWT. The application issues that for the IAM tool to verify it
	* JWT tokens are ideal for expire in short time and provide a refresh token. An IAM tool already have this functionality
* Hibernate

* Postgresql
