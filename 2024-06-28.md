* jdtls doesn't seems to catch my configs of user gradle home. Has to set it manually with an .sh

* Kafka
	* The recommended OS environment is Linux
	* Feels like kafka supports java 8, but using the latest is optimal
	* Thinking about zookeeper, kafka now don't needs it, as it gonna use KRaft mode directly, but how can it synchronize distributively without zookeeper? I think the zookeeper role is a same as Netflix Eureka
	* I already know how to setup kafka in docker (and have a simple docker file to deal with it), but how is it with zookeeper?
* Zookeeper
	* Instalation
		* untar it
		* put a `zoo.cfg` in conf with following keys
			* tickTime=2000
			* dataDir=whatever dir
			* clientPort=2181 is preferably
	* Designed to run in a cluster. That way it's recommended to have a odd numbers of node in a ensemble (cluster)
	* The optimal way to get the most out of zookeeper is using five nodes
		* Search about configuring zookeeper ensembles
* Good exercises 
	* configure zookeeper 5 node ensemble in docker compose set
	* search the differences between configuring kafka with zookeeper vs configuring with KRaft mode
* Kafka is already in Scala 2.13 yet (!!!!!!). No scala 3 :/
* Apparently, zookeeper was used more in previous versions, so, it makes sense the way kafka is going to let alone zookeeper
* What is a chroot path?
* Why it's a good practice to use a chroot path for a kafka cluster in zookeeper connect?
* Starting small and expanding as needed is easier than starting too large
* Kafka brokers have small consume
* Disk processing and RAM memory is more important than CPU
