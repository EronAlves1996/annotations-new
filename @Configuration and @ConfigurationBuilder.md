### Exercise 1: Basic Configuration

- Create a configuration class to hold application properties like `app.name`, `app.version`, and `app.environment`.
- Inject the configuration class into a controller and expose these properties as endpoints.
- Write unit tests to verify the configuration values.

### Exercise 2: Complex Configuration Structure

- Design a configuration structure for a book store application, including properties for:
    - General application settings (name, version, etc.)
    - Database configuration (type, host, port, username, password)
    - Book-related settings (default category, allowed file formats)
    - Email settings (host, port, username, password)
- Create configuration classes and use `@ConfigurationProperties` and `@ConfigurationBuilder` as needed.
- Write unit tests to cover different configuration scenarios.

### Exercise 3: Configuration Profiles

- Create multiple configuration profiles (e.g., `dev`, `prod`, `test`) with different property values.
- Implement a mechanism to activate different profiles based on environment variables or system properties.
- Write unit tests to verify profile switching.

### Exercise 4: Configuration Validation

- Add validation constraints to configuration properties using Micronaut's validation framework.
- Handle validation errors gracefully.
- Write unit tests to verify validation behavior.

### Exercise 5: Configuration with @EachProperty

- Create a configuration class to hold a list of users with properties like `username`, `email`, and `roles`.
- Use `@EachProperty` to map configuration properties to a list of user objects.
- Write unit tests to verify the mapping process.

### Exercise 6: Configuration and Dependency Injection

- Create a custom bean that depends on configuration properties.
- Inject the bean into a controller and demonstrate its usage.
- Write unit tests to verify the dependency injection.

### Exercise 7: Advanced Configuration Scenarios

- Explore using environment variables as configuration sources.
- Implement custom property resolvers.
- Create hierarchical configuration structures using nested configurations.
- Handle optional configuration properties.

### Additional Challenges

- Combine configuration with other Micronaut features like data binding and validation.
- Implement a custom configuration processor for specific use cases.
- Optimize configuration loading performance for large configuration files.
- Explore using configuration management tools like Spring Cloud Config.
